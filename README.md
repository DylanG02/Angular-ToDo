## Description 
This was my first creation with the Angular framework to learn how some of the basics work
- Angular Forms - Using Angular forms to create a way for the user to pass information to the applcation
- NgFor - Applying NgFor to loop over a list in an array to create elements of stored inputs from the user
- NgOnit - Implementing the use of lifecycle methods
- Anguar Components - Creating and managing different Angular components

## Further Improvements
